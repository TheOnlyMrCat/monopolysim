# TheOnlyMrCat/monopolysim
This is an old project that I worked on when I was new to programming in Java. It was a simulator for the board game 'monopoly' and simulated movement, property ownership, and jail. The code by my current standards was absolutely revolting; I didn't use objects to their full potential, I used static values way too much. I kept a scanner open in the [Init](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/monopolysim/blob/master/chance/src/com/dockdev/chance/Init.java) class, along with incorrect `System.exit(int)` codes. I had no idea how to properly do windowing ([Windowed](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/monopolysim/blob/master/chance/src/com/dockdev/chance/Windowed.java) and [App](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/monopolysim/blob/master/chance/src/com/dockdev/chance/App.java) classes), I never got around to finishing it anyway, and my output file technique was absolutely revolting ([Data class](https://github.com/TheOnlyMrCat/monopolysim/blob/master/chance/src/com/dockdev/chance/Data.java)).
